## Introduction
In this assignment I focused on bus arrival time data in Hong Kong and the process of drafting a formal enquiry, drawing on course materials and AI collaboration to shape my approach.

## Main Body
I learned that Hong Kong's data transparency is uneven: timetables and some real-time feeds are publicly available, but granular historical arrival logs and vehicle-specific GPS traces often require formal requests or data-sharing agreements. Identifying the precise datasets I needed—per-stop arrival timestamps, bus-route versions, and probe-sample sizes—was challenging and required iterative refinement. Crafting a professional enquiry taught me to be specific, cite intended analyses, and request formats (CSV/JSON) to minimise back-and-forth. The AI agent helped by structuring my letter, suggesting clarifying questions, and pointing to likely data owners, though it sometimes missed domain subtleties a tutor might catch. Through collaboration I improved technical communication and learned how to translate analytic needs into concise data requests. If the request is denied, I will use open-source probe data, crowdsourced timings, and simulated schedules as backups. Access to official arrival logs would significantly strengthen model validation and policy recommendations about bus reliability.

## Conclusion
This project clarified the practical limits of open data and improved my formal enquiry skills. I will apply these lessons to future data requests, emphasising clear data specifications and contingency plans.
